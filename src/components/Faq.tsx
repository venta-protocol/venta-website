    question: "What is Venta?",
    answer:
      "Venta is a stablecoin payment and rewards API for POS systems. It lets you offer fast, low-fee stablecoin payments to your merchants — with built-in revenue sharing, rewards, and campaign tools.",
  },
  // {
  //   question: "How does Venta make money?",
  //   answer:
  //     "Venta charges a base fee of 0.7% per transaction. As a POS partner, you can add your own markup (e.g. 0.3%), which goes directly to you. No subscriptions or setup fees.",
  // },
  {
    question: "How do I integrate Venta into my POS system?",
    answer:
      "We provide a simple REST and WebSocket-based API. You can embed our payment flow, access real-time updates, and optionally white-label the QR experience — all with full developer support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Venta require crypto knowledge?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. We abstract the Web3 components. Merchants log in with social auth, and funds go directly to their wallet — no seed phrases, no technical setup.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this compatible with our existing POS features?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Venta can run alongside your current setup or be embedded directly. It works as a lightweight add-on that enhances your offering without disrupting your flow.",
  },
